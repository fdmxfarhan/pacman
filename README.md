## introduction
This game is made with Ctalk CodeBlocks software which you can download and install with [this link](http://www.ctalk.ir/downloads/CodeBlocks-setup-(ctalk.ir).exe). Whoever is reading this readme, just know that me and the love of my life, Negar, worked on this game not just for fun but for realizing how it feels when you create something, something that will make you remember a feeling that you had once at a time. and that feeling is love. its the most important part of our lives. it's actually the reason why we live. So make Love, have fun and enjoy your life.

## Functional Coding
Everything in this project is fucntional and easy to undrestand. There is a main function that contains tree loops. One for selecting the difficulty. One for selecting the map and the other is for the main game loop.
