# Pac-man Game
This game is made with Ctalk CodeBlocks software wich you can download and install with [this link](http://www.ctalk.ir/downloads/CodeBlocks-setup-(ctalk.ir).exe). Whoever is reading this readme, just know that me and the love of my life, Negar, worked on this game not just for fun but for realizing how it feels when you create something, something that will make you remember a feeling that you had once at a time. and that feeling is love. its the most important part of our lives. its actually the reason why we leave.
